          <p>Sany Group began in 1989 as a small welding material factory. Its founders   are Liang Wengen, Tang Xiuguo, Mao Zhongwu and Yuan Jinhua. Now it has grown   into a global corporation with five industrial parks in China, four R&amp;D and   manufacturing bases in America, Germany, India and Brazil, and 21 sales   companies around the world. On July 1, the British newspaper Financial Times   released the 2011 list of the world’s 500 most valuable companies (FT Global   500) ranked by market capitalization. Sany Heavy Industry (Code: 600031) was put   on the list of FT Global 500 for the first time, ranked 431st, with a market cap   of 21.584 billion US dollars. Sany has become the first company listed among the   world’s top 500 companies in China’s construction machinery industry. Currently,   Sany employs about 70,000 people in more than 150 countries.<BR>
            <BR>
            At Sany, we   believe that developing and manufacturing of quality, industry-leading products   is always a top priority. Each year, Sany group re-invests 5-7% of its sales   revenue into the R&amp;D, making it possible to expand its product lines to   concrete, road, port, hoisting, pile driving, excavating machineries and wind   energy products. Now as one of the most successful enterprises in China, Sany   Group ranks 6th among the top 50 global construction machinery manufacturers. In   2007 and 2009, Sany Heavy Industry's self-developed 66m and 72m concrete pump   trucks created Guinness World Records twice as the concrete pump with the   longest boom. It demonstrated to the world that China became a leader in   concrete pumping technology. On Sep 19th, 2011, Sany Heavy Industry's 86m   concrete pump truck, which owns the longest boom in the world, successfully   rolled off the production line. Once again, Sany has shown that there is no   limit for Sany in concrete pumping technology.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides constantly improving the quality of our products, Sany Group is also   committed to providing customers with all-round and efficient services. 15   logistics centers and spare parts warehouses have been set up with logistics and   service systems all over the world.<BR>
            <BR>
